 **Enable automated testing on windows and other general sample
        platform improvements**

The sample platform has been a good way to test regression tests, but
still lacks windows support. It's been foreseen, but unfinished. It
should be finished, so we can ensure it's working both on Linux and
Windows. Besides that, there are some things that need to be finished.
This task thus encompasses:

a\) Windows support b) FTP upload support c) Improved error
detection d) Other small listed improvements on the issue
