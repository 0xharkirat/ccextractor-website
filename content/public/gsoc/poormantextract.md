title: "Poor Man's Textract"
---

 **Introduction**

Amazon Textract a (paid) service that "automatically extracts text and
data from scanned documents. Amazon Textract goes beyond simple optical
character recognition (OCR) to also identify the contents of fields in
forms and information stored in tables.". We want to build a free
alternative that provides an output of similar quality.

 **Your job**

- [Musab Kılıç's exam analyzer](https://github.com/musabkilic/ExamAnalyzer)
- [RobOHt's exam analyzer](https://https://github.com/RobOHt/AutomataQP-Decomposer)
- [knightron0's exam analyzer](https://github.com/knightron0/exam-analyzer)
