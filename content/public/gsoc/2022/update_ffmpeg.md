Anshul Maheshwari (@anshul on slack). Anshul did the original FFmpeg integration as a student.  

**Time estimation**  
175 hours

### Project Brief
We use FFmpeg to decode video, which we need to do when we want to process burned-in captions. FFmpeg recently changed their API (making it a lot better) but that has broken the existing clients.  

This might seem like a mundane task, but in the process you will learn to use the most important open source video tool - FFmpeg, without having to dig into its internals (if you wanted to do that then you could check out their own ideas page).  

This is an important project for us (since it affects our core tool) so if there is a good proposal it is guaranteed to be picked.
