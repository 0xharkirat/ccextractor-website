### Project Brief
Regolith Linux is a collection of packages, currently for Debian and Ubuntu, to deliver a preconfigured world class i3/sway experience. 

nix is well known linux distribution with very interesting features such as almost perfect reproducibility.

We'd like to get Regolith on nix. 

From what we've been told, this is doable but hard. 

There is currently an open [issue](https://github.com/regolith-linux/regolith-desktop/issues/604) which discusses this in detail. It might be a good idea to read through the issue before contributing.

### Your Job

Deliver nix derivations get a regolith experience on nix.

### Qualification tasks

- Create nix derivations for [ilia](https://github.com/regolith-linux/ilia) and [regolith-rofication](https://github.com/regolith-linux/regolith-rofication). 
- `ilia` should work on both sway and i3. Users should be able to recieve notifications with `rofication` and view them in ilia under both sessions.
- Bonus points if you can make it easy to switch between `rofication` and `dunst`.
