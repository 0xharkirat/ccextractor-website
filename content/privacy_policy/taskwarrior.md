### TasKwarrior Mobile privacy police

*First version (2023-08-10)*

Our app does not share _any_ personal data with us. 
If you decide to use an external server to sync your data, for example inthe.am, then your tasks (only) will be send to such service following the taskwarrior protocol. 

We reserve the right to add some telemetry to our app to gather usage statistics.

The [source code](https://github.com/CCExtractor/taskwarrior-flutter) of the app is open source and you can always inspect it (and contribute to it). We guarantee that the source source on github corresponds exactly to what is published on the Play Store.
