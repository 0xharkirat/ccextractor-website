### Flood Mobile privacy police

*First version (2023-10-23)*

Our app does not share _any_ personal data with us. 
Since the point of this app if for you to manage an external server (that you should be in control of), then data will be exchanged as needed with that server.
We provide the app, but not any service (paid or not). If you don't manage the server(s) you connect to and instead rely on a 3rd party to provide such a service, please go to their privacy policy for details.

We reserve the right to add some telemetry to our app to gather usage statistics.

The [source code]([https://github.com/CCExtractor/taskwarrior-flutter](https://github.com/CCExtractor/Flood_Mobile) of the app is open source and you can always inspect it (and contribute to it). We guarantee that the source source on github corresponds exactly to what is published on the Play Store.
